  "aboutContent1": "I graduated from the Department of Applied Geology at NationalCentral University. After graduation, I became a project manager in the environmental consulting industry. Due to the nature of the projects I was involved in, I found myself writing code, which led me to explore the field of front-end development. Intrigued by this, I started self-learning online.",
  "aboutContent2": "I eventually made a bold decision to further my education at the Institute for Information Industry (|||) and transition my career. After completing my studies, I joined CINO Group, a company primarily focused on developing and selling scanners. In my role, I not only work on front-end web development but also handle back-end development (using Express) and database integration (using MongoDB). In addition to this, I also utilize electron.js to create desktop applications, assisting customers in updating or configuring the company's products and helping optimize operational processes for the factory and testing department.",
  "aboutContent3": "In my free time, I enjoy playing badminton, cycling, and card games. I also use my spare time to improve my programming skills. Currently, I'm diligently working on enhancing my proficiency in React and TypeScript. I'm also collaborating with a partner I met at the Institute for Information Industry to create a full-stack side project related to card games.",

  "pta1": "The purpose of this project is to provide card game enthusiasts with the ability to browse articles written by other users, search for cards, and assemble card decks. Additionally, by utilizing the price data obtained through the web crawler, we aim to make card prices more transparent. Users can also apply for an account to become a blogger on this website, allowing them to write articles in the backend for other users to view.",
  "po1": "The current CMS and backend have been roughly completed. The web crawler has been deployed on AWS EC2, performing price data crawling at fixed times every day. Only the user interface is currently under development and is expected to be completed around December 2023. At that time, the plan is to deploy it on AWS, possibly in conjunction with Nginx.",

  "pr1": "This project involves the development of a desktop application designed to complement the functionality of a scanner. The application allows users to update, adjust parameters, configure formats, and perform other functions related to the scanner. Additionally, it has the capability to generate parameter correction files in various formats such as PDF, WORD, and PNG.",
  "pr2": "This project is a desktop application that communicates with a Bluetooth scanner through the comport communication method. It interacts with the software of the Bluetooth scanner's dongle to obtain the Bluetooth Mac address. Subsequently, it generates a barcode to facilitate quick pairing between the Bluetooth scanner and the dongle software.",
  "pr3": "This project serves as a Content Management System (CMS) designed to manage all crucial parameters, documents, and databases within the company. It is a ground-up initiative that involves planning user processes, creating an Entity-Relationship (ER) model, wireframing, selecting a database, developing the CMS interface and backend, and deploying the project onto the company's server using Nginx. The project has completed its initial phase and is currently in active use."
